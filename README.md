# n8n-file-validation-workflow
This project contains an n8n workflow designed to extract, validate, and consolidate data from an XLSX file containing multiple sheets. The workflow applies custom validation rules (JavaScript), merges the validation outputs, and triggers follow-up actions such as sending an email notification or updating a Google Sheet.
